# Data Analysis of the “War of the Five Kings” - Game of Thrones


## Before It Starts

This is my first project of data analysis, and it is wriiten by Jupyter notebook. The project is adopted from Data Analyst (Advance) Nanodegree program from Udacity. The dataset is adopted from Myles O'Neill from Kaggle. I am not a fan of Game of Thrones (even never watched). All conclusions are based on given dataset, which may not be accurate. Anyone who wants to use my code or conclusion persoanlly must refer to the source.


## Introduction

The War of the Five Kings is a famous civil war described in the well-known serious fantasy novel “Game of Thrones”. This is a civil strife with an unprecedented scale that involves seven kingdoms. As the name implies, a total of five persons claim to be the king during the war: Joffrey Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon all claim to be the rightful heir of the iron throne. Moreover, Robb Stark is elected by the barons of the northern border to the King in the North, and Balon Greyjoy erects the flag of independence again and claims to be the King of the Iron Islands, in an attempt to shake off the ruling of the Iron Throne.
